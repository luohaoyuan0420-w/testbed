This is a test bed completely designed by Haoyuan Luo for 3D printed mini turbine engine. It can provide oil supply for the engine and measure oil consumption, thrust, exhaust temperature, rotation speed and vibration of the engine. The program for the control system is "欣然动力数据采集系统.vi" written in Labview. "微型试车台BOM.xlsx" is the bill of materials, and "试车台控制箱说明书.pdf" is the instruction book.
